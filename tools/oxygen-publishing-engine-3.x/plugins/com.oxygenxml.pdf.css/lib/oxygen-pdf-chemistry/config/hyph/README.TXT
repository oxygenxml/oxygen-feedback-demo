DESCRIPTION
===========

This folder contains the hyphenation dictionaries.

These dictionaries are from the TeX project and may be found in the original form in the CTAN archive:
https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/tex/

In this folder you may see them in XML and Apache FOP binary format. The OFFO project is doing all these conversions:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/offo/
